# GitHub Actions CI/CD Demo Project

This project demonstrates a basic full-stack application with a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. The application consists of a React frontend and an Express.js backend.

## Quick Summary

- **Frontend:** A simple React application that displays a "Hello from React!" message.

- **Backend:** An Express.js server that responds with a "Hello from Express!" message.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions is used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the project:

1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**
   - Set up an Elastic Beanstalk environment for the backend. Refer to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk documentation for instructions.

2. **AWS S3 Bucket:**
   - Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account. Use the name "forza-github-actions" for the bucket.

3. **GitHub Secrets:**
   - In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" > "Secrets".
   - Add two secrets: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your AWS access and secret keys.

4. **Commit and Push:**
   - Commit the changes to your project files and push them to the main branch.

5. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` on each push to the main branch.

6. **Monitor Workflow Execution:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress and details of the workflow execution.

7. **Verify Deployments:**
   - Check your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment for the deployed backend.
   - Verify that the frontend build artifacts are present in the S3 bucket.

## Notes

- Customize configurations in `.github/workflows/main.yml` based on your project requirements.
- Adjust AWS regions, security configurations, or dependencies as needed.
